# React-Phaser Bridge Rules

## Component Structure
- Use the PhaserGame component as the bridge between React and Phaser
- Maintain the ref pattern to access game and scene instances
- Follow React best practices for state management with Phaser

## EventBus Usage
- Use EventBus for all communications between React and Phaser
- Keep event names consistent and documented
- Clean up event listeners in useEffect return functions
- Be careful with event payload structure

## State Management
- Determine whether state should live in React or Phaser
- Avoid duplicating state between React and Phaser
- Use React for UI state, Phaser for game state
- Consider performance implications when sharing large amounts of data

## Rendering
- Never manipulate the Phaser canvas directly from React
- Keep the React component tree clean and focused
- Use React for UI elements, Phaser for game elements
- Ensure proper cleanup when components unmount
