# Project Structure Rules

## Directory Organization
- Keep React components in `src/` root
- Place all Phaser game code in `src/game/`
- Organize Phaser scenes in `src/game/scenes/`
- Store assets in `public/assets/`
- Use appropriate file extensions: `.tsx` for React, `.ts` for TypeScript

## Asset Management
- Place all game assets in `public/assets/`
- Use proper loading techniques in Phaser's preload method
- Follow asset naming conventions consistently
- Consider using texture atlases for related sprites

## Module Organization
- Use proper TypeScript imports and exports
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Keep modules focused on a single responsibility
- Use barrel exports where appropriate to simplify imports

## Configuration
- Store game configuration in `src/game/main.ts`
- Use constants for magic values
- Consider extracting configuration to dedicated config files for complex setups
- Follow the template's organization for new features
