Fix mobile ui and visuals
Gamescene is very large and looks to duplicate touch controls


Remove minimap and have it be a zoom state - implement a mobile pinch zoom to work



Swap out salvage
Make the basic game loop - collect 3 mcguffins before x time to win.
Add loot style salvage pickup - One deposit show what you got, have it fly into the individual items.  Should feel like a slot machine.

Change tether fx to be a visual fx on the salvage rather than showing the radius.  
Fix world map visuals



Ships = extra ships (implement damage for ships)
Survivors = extra lives (Implement survivor as a final life)
Once all the survivors are dead you loose.
Get your astro survivors home.  Use your ship to collect fuel and repair your ship to get it home. ( Your ship was blown up at the start of the war.  You command your soldiers to repair and fuel the ship to get it back to the front and defend your home. You are preparing for the final battle.  If you stay at any site too long the enemy will show up and try to destroy your ship.)
